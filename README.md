Debuggable Classes
==================

The source code in this project contains several different version of a
`Debuggable` class from my book, [Learning Functional Programming in
Scala](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/fp-book/learning-functional-programming-in-scala).
These classes are used in the following lessons:

- Using `bind` in a `for` Expression
- A Generic Version of `Debuggable`
- One Last `Debuggable`: (`List` Instead of `String`)
